  <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
  <p> The software development process is a methodical strategy for creating and developing software for a system or project. 
    it is the process software developers and programmers use to build computer/software programs. 
    In short, it is the process of planning.  
    
  <p> Software design is important as it ensures efficiency. It is so crucial as poor design quality can lead to inefficiency and errors. 
    Let's say you want to build an app, software design is the plan and outline of your app development process. If another developer is 
    brought in to complete the app development process, they will be able to read the software design and proceed without becoming lost or confused.

  <p> A software I use that I believe was designed well is WhatsApp. 
    I personally find this software to be well designed because many people have loved ones they want to speak with but can't due to distance -
    that was the case with me. This software helped me connect with my dad despite him living halfway across the world.
    Because of this software, I can now call, facetime, and chat with him whenever I want.
    Furthermore, WhatsApp is well designed because of its user-friendly interface, regular updates to enhance performance and security, 
    as well as its overall simplicity. The app offers reliable messaging worldwide which keeps your messages private and secure,
    effective group chats and calls, status updates, and is centered on mobility. 
    These factors all contribute to the overall effectiveness and quality of the app.
